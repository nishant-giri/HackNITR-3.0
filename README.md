# HackNITR 3.0

The painful sight of seeing a motor neuron patient is heartbreaking. Motor neurone disease is an uncommon condition that affects the brain and nerves.There are treatments to help reduce the impact it has on a person's daily life but no cure.We have created a solution for this painful sight. Our project aims to solve the problems of the people by assisting them with smart Goggles Assist using a platform with flexible APIs for any channel and built-in intelligence - TWILIO. It works on the IR sensor principle using the voluntary blinking of eyes which helps the patient to communicate with others in case of an emergency or for other purposes to make the person feel more lively. On the software side , we have used python libraries such as tkinter.
